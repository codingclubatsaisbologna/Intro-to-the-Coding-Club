# Intro-to-the-Coding-Club
Brief breakdown of the Coding Club's purpose and the areas of our interest and study.

# Mission Statement
“The Coding Club at SAIS Bologna wants to introduce to students some of the basics of programming and impart a sense of the growing importance of programming and programming-related skills in the modern workplace. We will mainly be talking in terms of languages like R, Python, MatLab and SQL, while discussions will encompass blockchain technologies, machine learning, statistical and data analysis, and data visualization. Our goal is to provide a structured resource which students may develop novice skills and deepen their understanding of technology. We will do this through shared experience, weekly meetings - tackling coding challenges and tasks - as well as guest speakers who are professionals in these various fields.”

# Our Purpose
  - We want to be a resource for students with interests in the practical aspects of programming
  - We also want to be a resource for students with intellectual and academic interests in technology
  - We'll help you develop awareness and keep up to date with developments in the tech sphere
    - Specifically as it relates to the political and financial realms
  - If you're new or relatively new to programming we aim to help you develop skills in programming

# Areas of Discussion
  - Statistical Analysis
  - Data Analysis
  - Data Visualization
  - Blockchain Technologies
  - Machine Learning

# Programming Languages and Software
  - R
  - Python
  - SQL
  - Matlab
  - Tableau

# Why Should You (as a SAIS student) Care About Programming?
Some of history’s most seminal events are related to:
  - Technological development
    - From the “dark” ages, enlightenment, industrial age and the information age
    - “the rise of the west"
  - Access to information
    - Invention of the printing press
    - Religion, War, Nationalism and the Sovereign State
    - Big Data & Privacy

# Contentious Issues with Tech
### Robots and AI are displacing workforces:
  - A Tax on Tech? Or, should governments invest in training workforces for the skills needed in the coming century?
    - Universal Wage?
    - Trends in Populism to Persist?

### Open Internet?
  - How much should access to information cost?
  - Public-Private Partnerships in internet infrastructure development

### Blockchain
  - Broader access to financial services in the developing world
  - Efficient self-regulation of the banking industry
  - A tool for criminals? Silk road, terrorism financing

### Privacy and Manipulation
  - Cambridge Analytica, Facebook, Palantir, WikiLeaks
